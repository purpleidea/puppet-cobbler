Module specific notes:
* This is a rather big module. It also adds some functionality to cobbler.
* A simple run (with no work to do) of this module can take about four minutes.
* Any run which needs a reposync can take even longer.
* This module isn't perfect, and a large architectural change is planned.
* (FIXME) Getting this deployed might take a few runs and some manual hacking.
* At the moment, this manages all your systems, profiles, etc...
* Don't try out this module for the first time on a production machine!
